# Twatch

Twatch (Terror Watch) is a website created to help keep track of emergency events such as Boko Haram and other terrorist attacks, kidnappings, banditry and riots in Nigeria. The idea is that people within the vicinity of an attack can report such incidences in real time, so that other people avoid the trouble zones at that time. Also, I hope to include a mechanism for alerting the Nigerian military or police force when such reports are created.

Twatch was conceived at VandyHacks IX (Ocean Edition, 2022) and is still in development. It will be updated as time progresses. The next step for now is setting up a node/express server, and then setting up a database and add additional features. The goal is to have Twatch fully deployed and running by New Year's day of 2023.

For now, to get a general sense of what Twatch is going to do, feel free to follow the following steps:

**(Update 1)**

1. Download the Twatch folder from the github repository.
2. Make sure you have node installed https://nodejs.org/en/download/
3. Installing node should come with npm.
4. Make sure you have nodemon installed by using the terminal command npm install -g nodemon
5. Install express by using the terminal command npm install express
6. Install dotenv by using npm install dotenv
7. Then navigate into the Twatch folder and use npm start in the terminal to load up th express server.
8. Finally, in your browser, type "localhost:3000". This should show you where Twatch is at right now.

As at this update, Twatch has now incorporoted Node.js and Express.js, in addition to the HTML/CSS, Bootstrap and vanilla Javascript in the first commit. 
The next step for me is making some design choices on how Twatch will operate behind the scenes, and then deciding what kind of database to use. Even though I'm familiar with databases and have used them in the past, I have yet to use one from scratch on my own, so this should be a really fun learning experience. Let me know if you have any suggestions.

Stay Tuned!

(Initial Commit)
1. Download the Twatch folder from the github repo.
2. Navigate to /Twatch/Twatch/index.html
3. Copy the full path of index.html and paste it in your browser. You should be able to see a glimpse into how Twatch is intended to operate.


Right now, Twatch runs on mostly HTML, CSS (Bootstrap) and a little Javascript. This will be updated as more frameworks become incorporated.
